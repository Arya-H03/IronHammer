//In the sacred tongue of the Omnissiah we chant:
//Hail spirit of the machine, essence divine,in your code and circuitry the stars align.
//By the Omnissiah's will we commune and bind, with sacred oils and chants your grace we find.
//Blessed be the gears, in perfect sync they turn, blessed be the sparks, in holy fire they burn.
//Through rites arcane, your wisdom we discern,in your hallowed core the sacred mysteries yearn.
